This (prototype) game was written over the course of around 30-40 hours, including messing about with the sprites. I challenged myself to write an engine and game within the course of 7 days while on vacation, causing me to have even less consecutive time to work on this. After a while, sacrifices had to be made to actually create a finished game with the tradeoff of having some really poor code. Please do not treat this as a representation of my abilities unless you value writing rapid prototype code to meet a gamejam deadline over thought-out extensible code! 

This was a great experience however, there are many improvements to be made to the engine specifically that would have allieviated many of the "hacks" nessessary to complete.
